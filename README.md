# Biography

Indigo - (They/Them)

Hello! If you aren't familiar with me personally, then you will know me from my online personality. So here is a bit about me, both professional and personal, that will hint you in as to know I am.

If you are looking for a custom Discord bot/app, or a webscrapper, please find my contact information at the bottom of this page. 

## Professional

I am an "up and coming" software engineer. I have been working with and in Python for the last year, and have been slowly branching out from that. 

Under my belt I can say I am confident in:
 - Python
 - HTML/CSS
 - Git(Hub)
 - Linux (Arch BTW ;3)

I am less confident in, but learning:
 - JavaScript
 - GoLang
 - MySQL
 - Docker

 When learning, I always take the project based learning approach. I learn by solving problems. In this, I am entirely self taught. Thought for first time, I am getting a formal education in Computer Science, in collage!

## Personal

I'm a 17 year old with a passion for music, philosophy, psychology, and sciences. There is nothing that escapes my curiousity. 

I try to be very open minded, and use my skills in thinking to form my beliefs, opinions, and ideas in a healthy and constructive way.

Some of beliefs that are relivant to tech are:
 - I dislike the way AI is being used, but I love the AI itself.
 - I am a big believer in Open Source, however I also believe in a big importance in compencating Developrs, whether via donations or other means.
 - I think people should use the tools that suit them the best. (if the tool doesn't exist, make it!)
 - I have a general distaste towards gatekeeping (especially in the tech world).

Bit of a former "egg". ;3
Some of my favorite colors are blue, white and pink.
